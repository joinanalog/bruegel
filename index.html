    <h1>Netherlandish Proverbs</h1>
    <p>
      In 1559 the Flemish artist <strong>Pieter Bruegel the Elder</strong> painted the panel <em>Nederlandse Spreekwoorden</em> including on it literal illustrations of <strong>more than a hundred</strong> Dutch language proverbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of these proverbs focus on <strong>the absurdity of much of our human behaviour</strong> and Bruegel's renditions reinforce this interpretation portraying a world literally turned upside down. At the same time some of the more serious proverbs illustrate <strong>the dangers of folly</strong>, which leads to sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've created this interactive version of the analog painting so you can playfully discover the <strong>tons of popular wisdom</strong> buried on it. Enjoy!
